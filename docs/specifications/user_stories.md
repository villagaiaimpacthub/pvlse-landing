- Multi-factor authentication enforced for all administrative access

### 3. Healthcare Data Handling Transparency

**As a** healthcare security officer,
**I want to** understand exactly how employee and operational data will be processed and stored,
**So that** I can assess HIPAA compliance risks and data sovereignty requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Data flow diagrams showing all touch points and storage locations
- Clear definition of what constitutes PHI in workforce analytics context
- Geographic data residency guarantees (must remain in US for our requirements)
- Data processing agreements clearly define purpose limitation and use restrictions
- Employee consent mechanisms documented and legally reviewed
- Right to data portability and deletion procedures tested and validated
- Audit logging captures all data access with immutable timestamps

### 4. Healthcare Operational Integration Security

**As a** healthcare CISO,
**I want to** ensure the AI solution integrates securely with existing healthcare systems,
**So that** we don't create new attack vectors or compromise patient care systems.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Network segmentation requirements documented and implementable
- API security follows healthcare-grade authentication (OAuth 2.0 + FHIR standards preferred)
- Integration points with EHR systems follow established security protocols
- No direct access to patient care networks or medical devices
- Change management procedures align with healthcare operational windows
- Disaster recovery procedures tested with healthcare-specific RTO/RPO requirements (RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour)

### 5. Vendor Risk Assessment for Healthcare

**As a** healthcare CISO performing vendor due diligence,
**I want to** validate the vendor's security maturity and financial stability,
**So that** I can ensure long-term security and service continuity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- SIG (Standardized Information Gathering) questionnaire completed with supporting evidence
- Financial stability demonstrated through audited financial statements
- Cyber insurance coverage minimum $10M with healthcare-specific coverage
- Security incident history disclosed with remediation evidence
- Background checks completed for all personnel with access to healthcare data
- Subprocessor/vendor list provided with their security assessments
- Contractual liability caps align with healthcare risk tolerance (minimum $25M)

### 6. Healthcare-Specific Implementation Security

**As a** healthcare CISO planning AI deployment,
**I want to** define specific security requirements for our healthcare environment,
**So that** implementation maintains our security posture and regulatory compliance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Private cloud deployment option available (no multi-tenant for PHI)
- Dedicated security contact with healthcare experience assigned
- Implementation timeline allows for thorough security testing (minimum 90 days)
- Security configuration baselines documented and CIS-compliant
- Monitoring integration with existing healthcare SIEM/SOC capabilities
- Privileged access management (PAM) integration for administrative functions
- Regular security assessments included in service agreement (quarterly minimum)

### 7. Board-Level Risk Communication

**As a** healthcare CISO reporting to the board,
**I want to** articulate AI implementation risks in business terms,
**So that** board members can make informed decisions about workforce analytics investments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Risk assessment quantifies financial impact of potential security incidents
- Compliance risk clearly stated in terms of regulatory penalties
- Comparison with industry benchmarks and peer healthcare organizations
- Implementation timeline includes board review checkpoints
- Success metrics include security KPIs alongside business outcomes
- Exit strategy documented in case of vendor security failures
- Insurance implications assessed and board-approved

## Security Concerns Requiring Immediate Attention

Based on the current PVLSE landing page assessment, the following critical gaps must be addressed:

### Critical Issues (Deal Breakers)
1. **No HIPAA/Healthcare Compliance Mentioned**: Landing page lacks any healthcare-specific compliance language
2. **Vague Security Claims**: "Military-grade encryption" and "SOC 2 compliant" without evidence or specificity
3. **No Healthcare Experience**: No case studies or references from healthcare organizations
4. **Insufficient Data Handling Details**: Claims of "trained on your data" without privacy safeguards explanation

### High-Priority Concerns
1. **Generic Enterprise Focus**: Messaging doesn't address healthcare operational constraints
2. **No Regulatory Expertise**: Missing healthcare regulatory knowledge demonstration
3. **Unclear Data Residency**: No mention of data location or sovereignty guarantees
4. **Limited Security Documentation**: No link to detailed security whitepapers or compliance evidence

### Implementation Blockers
1. **No Healthcare-Specific Pricing**: Pricing model doesn't account for healthcare compliance overhead
2. **Missing Compliance Certifications**: HITRUST, HITECH not mentioned
3. **No Healthcare References**: Cannot validate vendor healthcare experience
4. **Insufficient Technical Detail**: Security architecture not available for technical review

## Minimum Requirements for Further Evaluation

For Dr. Kim to recommend moving forward with PVLSE evaluation, the following must be immediately provided:

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Comprehensive security whitepaper with healthcare-specific controls
- [ ] Current SOC 2 Type II audit report
- [ ] HIPAA Business Associate Agreement template
- [ ] Data processing and privacy impact assessment
- [ ] Healthcare customer references and case studies

### Compliance Evidence
- [ ] HITRUST certification or roadmap
- [ ] Current penetration testing report
- [ ] Incident response plan with healthcare-specific procedures
- [ ] Data retention and destruction policies
- [ ] Geographic data residency guarantees

### Technical Architecture
- [ ] Security architecture diagrams
- [ ] Data flow documentation with PHI handling
- [ ] API security documentation
- [ ] Encryption implementation details
- [ ] Access control and privilege management procedures

## Conclusion

The current PVLSE landing page presents significant security and compliance gaps that would prevent approval in a healthcare environment. While the AI solution may have merit, the security posture and healthcare compliance readiness cannot be validated from the available information.

**Recommendation**: Request comprehensive security documentation and healthcare-specific compliance evidence before proceeding with any formal evaluation or budget allocation.

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Insufficient information to validate regulatory compliance and security controls necessary for healthcare deployment.
